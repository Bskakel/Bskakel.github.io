<h1> Robotics </h1>
<p> I am the current president and co-founder
of Excelsiors robotics team. As President
I call together meetings. I help decide where
our funding goes. I also supervise meetings
 and work with the vise president to create
 groups within our club to carry out
  projects. We compete in competitions held by FTC.
  Each year they create a new task or challenge
  for competitors robots to complete.
</p>

<h1> Public Speaking </h1>
<p> I have had many opportunities to practice my public
  speaking skills. From fourth to sixth grade I helped
   run assemblies every friday morning in front
   of the entire school. In high school I helped with
  open house where I spoke about how Excelsior was a great school.
  I also went to the middle schools in my district speaking about
  Excelsior and answering questions from 8th graders.
</p>

<h1> Junior Honor Society </h1>
<p> In junior honor society I helped run fundraisers
  and blood drives. We had 2 blood drives each year
  where we invited people to donate blood for the Red
   Cross. I also attended a leadership program where
   I went to D.C for a week during the summer and
    learned about history and current events.
