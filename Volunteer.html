 <h1> Dutchess </h1>
 <p> I volunteer for the EMS program at Dutchess Community
    College. As per a requirement in the course students
     have to practice what theyve learned in the form of
      hands on tests called practicals. On the testing
       days or practice days I go to help. I get assigned
        one of the various stations for the test and serve
        as a “victim” for the duration of the test. I also
         help with the setup and organization of the tests.
</p>

 <h1> Animal Shelter </h1>
<p> Over the summer I volunteer at the Newburgh animal
 shelter by walking the dogs, and helping with the cats.
  I would go 1 to 2 times a week and help out. This usually
 consisted of feeding the animals or just giving them attention.
</p>

 <h1> Church </h1>
 <p> At my church I volunteer whenever I can.
    Every summer I help with their week long
     bible school. I take part in the setup,
      organization, and then teach one of the
      various classes. For a few years I was
       also an acolyte, they help carry out the
        church services by distributing communion,
         and collection offering. Right before
         Thanksgiving we would collect food for
 families that couldnt afford it and
 package it to be delivered. We did the same
  thing with Christmas stockings and Easter baskets
   during those seasons. I also helped teach weekly
    Sunday School classes for a while.
