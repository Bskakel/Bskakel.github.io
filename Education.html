<h1> Ptech </h1>
<p> In Newburghs ptech Excelsior Academy I will
earn both my high school diploma and A.A.S. degree.
I also have the opportunity to work on skills Ill
need in the real world like team collaboration and problem
solving. IBM supplies mentors to each of the students in Excelsior
and we are able to communicate with them to learn new things
and solve problems. When Im done Ill know the basics of either
Networking or Cyber Security and the workplace skills that
would make me a great employee for any company.
</p>
<h1> Independant Study </h1>
<p> I have taken multiple college certificate courses on
EdToGo.com. EdToGo is funded by Suny as a way for people
to learn about various topics without needing the
traditional classroom settings. Over the 2015 summer
I took html basics and introduction into the gaming
industry. Both courses I passed and got a certificate
of completion. I have also self taught myself Java
and plan to take an EMR class in the spring of 2016.
